# üöÄ Getting Started
This tool is tested on Python `3.10.12` and `Ubuntu`. But I hope this will work very well with other Python versions and Operating Systems as this tool doesn't require any particular OS-dependent library. But for the Python version compatibility with Google Python modules, once search on Google. But still, if you face any error repost it in the `Issues` section.
- Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/rmondal-official/PINAC-Workspace.git`
- Enable Google API with required scopes. Read the <a href="https://github.com/rmondal-official/PINAC-Workspace/blob/main/Google%20API%20Guide.md">Google API Guide</a> for it.
- Navigate to the project directory `cd PINAC-Workspace`
- Install the project dependencies by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Now once open the main.py file, follow the very small instructions written in the comment, then run the main script.
