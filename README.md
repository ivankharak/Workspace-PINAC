## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This tool is tested on Python `3.10.12` and `Ubuntu`. But this will work very well with other Python versions and operating systems as this tool doesn't require any particular OS-dependent library. But once search on Google for the Python version compatibility with google python modules. But still, if you face any error report it in the `Issues` section.

- **Clone the repository:** Get the masterpiece in your local system by running
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/rmondal-official/PINAC-Workspace.git
  ```

- **Activate Google API:** Unlock the power of Google API by following <a href="https://github.com/rmondal-official/PINAC-Workspace/blob/main/Google%20API%20Guide.md">our Google API Guide</a>. Don't worry; we've got your back! Dive into the Google API Guide for a smooth setup.

- **Navigate to the Project:** Step into the heart of PINAC-Workspace by navigating to the project directory: `cd PINAC-Workspace`

- **Obtain Your OpenAI API Key:** Create your OpenAI API key by going to <a href="https://platform.openai.com/api-keys">: Once you're logged in, navigate to the API Keys section and generate a new key.

- **Create the .env File** Inside your project's /src/configs directory, create a new file named .env. It's important to note that this file is typically ignored by version control systems (like Git) to prevent accidental exposure of your secret key.

- **Set the Environment Variable:** Open the .env file in a text editor and add the following line, replacing <YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY> with your actual key:
OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>


- **Prepare Your Machine**: Create the **Virtual Environment** by the name `venv` and activate it by running
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
  Hey, your workspace is ready! Now just install dependencies by running the command 
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
- **Launch Your Experience**: Once you've embarked on this exciting journey, run the `main.py` file and let the adventure begin! Connect to your Google Apps by clicking the **Sign Up** Button.
