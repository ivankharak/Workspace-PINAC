### PR recommendations

To allow your work to be integrated as seamlessly as possible, we advise you to:

✅ Verify your PR is **up-to-date** with `master` branch. If your PR is behind you can update your code by clicking the 'Update branch' button or by running `git pull` locally.

✅ Reduce changes to the absolute **minimum** required for your bug fix or feature addition. _"It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is."_ — Bruce Lee
