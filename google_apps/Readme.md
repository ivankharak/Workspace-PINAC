<h2 align="middle"> Getting Started with Google APIs :<br> A Beginner's Guide</h2>

This guide will walk you through the **basic steps** of getting started with Google APIs, making it easy for beginners.

### 1. Create a Google Cloud Project

To use Google APIs, you'll need a Google Cloud Project. It's free to create and easy to manage. Head over to: [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

Click "Create Project" and give it a descriptive name.

### 2. Enable Your Chosen API

Go back to the API Explorer page and find the specific API you want to use. Click on it and navigate to the "Enable API" section. Follow the on-screen instructions to enable the API for your project.

### 3. Create Credentials

To access the API, you'll need credentials, an OAuth client ID(needed for this project) or API key.  
Go to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/docs/api/quickstart/python#authorize_credentials_for_a_desktop_application">Page</a> and follow the instruction on it, step by step (if you are using google apis for first time on that account)

### 4. Install the Client Library

Use your chosen language's package manager (e.g., pip for Python, npm for JavaScript) to install the relevant client library. Refer to the library's documentation for specific installation instructions.

### 5. Write Your Code !
